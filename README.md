Vagrant/Puppet setup for sf2 install
==============================================================

puPHPet generated vagrant/puppet setup altered to provide a quick and easy sf2 setup.

Initial commit has no configuration setup so you'll want to edit Vagrantfile / manifests/default.pp
to change where symfony is installed. By default it will be installed to /var/www/symfony.
